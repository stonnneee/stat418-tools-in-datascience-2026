## 5. OpenRouter + Claude Code Setup

Claude Code (Cline) is an AI coding assistant that runs in VSCode. We'll use it with OpenRouter's free API to access Claude and other models.

### Step 1: Get a Free OpenRouter API Key

1. Visit [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Click "Sign In" in the top right
3. Sign in with your Google account (use your UCLA account or personal)
4. Once signed in, click on your profile icon → "Keys"
5. Click "Create Key"
6. Give it a name like "STAT418-Course"
7. Copy the API key and save it somewhere safe (you won't be able to see it again)

**Important**: OpenRouter provides free credits for new users and has free models available. The free tier is sufficient for this course.

### Step 2: Configure Claude Code (Cline)

1. In VSCode, click the Cline icon in the left sidebar (robot/chat icon)
2. Click the settings gear icon (⚙️) in the Cline panel
3. In the settings that appear:
   - **API Provider**: Select "OpenRouter"
   - **API Key**: Paste your OpenRouter API key
   - **Model**: Select "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet" (recommended) or a free model like "google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free"

### Step 3: Test Claude Code

1. Create a new file: `test.py`
2. Click the Cline icon in the left sidebar
3. Type: "Write a function that adds two numbers and returns the result"
4. Press Enter

If you get a response with Python code, you're all set! ✓

### Alternative Free Models on OpenRouter

If you want to use completely free models:
- `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` - Fast and capable
- `meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct:free` - Smaller but free
- `qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct:free` - Good for coding

You can switch models anytime in the Cline settings.

## 6. Fork and Clone the Course Repository

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Visit the course repository: [github.com/natelangholz/stat418-tools-in-datascience-2026](https://github.com/natelangholz/stat418-tools-in-datascience-2026)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top right
3. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account
4. You'll submit all assignments and your final project to different branches of your forked repo

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
# Navigate to where you want to store course materials
cd ~/Documents  # or wherever you prefer

# Clone YOUR fork (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/stat418-tools-in-datascience-2026.git

# Navigate into the repository
cd stat418-tools-in-datascience-2026

# Add the original repo as 'upstream' to get updates
git remote add upstream https://github.com/natelangholz/stat418-tools-in-datascience-2026.git
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Project Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install course dependencies
uv pip install -e .

# Install optional dependencies for LLM work
uv pip install -e ".[llm]"

# Install web development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[web]"
```

### Step 4: Create Your Assignment Branch

For each assignment, you'll create a new branch:

```bash
# Example for homework 1
git checkout -b hw1-yourname

# Do your work, then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Complete homework 1"
git push origin hw1-yourname

# Then create a Pull Request on GitHub to submit
```

---

## 7. Verification Test

Let's verify everything works together.

### Test the Course Environment

```bash
# Make sure you're in the course directory
cd stat418-tools-in-datascience-2026

# Activate virtual environment if not already active
source .venv/bin/activate

# Create a test file
cat > test_setup.py << 'EOF'
import sys
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import requests

print("✓ Python version:", sys.version)
print("✓ Pandas version:", pd.__version__)
print("✓ NumPy version:", np.__version__)
print("✓ Requests version:", requests.__version__)
print("\n✓✓✓ Setup successful! ✓✓✓")
EOF

# Run the test
python test_setup.py
```

**Expected output**: Version information and "Setup successful!"

### Test in VSCode with Claude Code

```bash
# Open the course directory in VSCode
code .
```

In VSCode:
1. Open `test_setup.py`
2. Click the Cline icon
3. Ask: "Add docstrings to this code and explain what it does"
4. If Cline responds with documentation, everything is working! ✓

---

## 8. Setting Up Your .env File

For projects that use API keys, you'll need a `.env` file:

```bash
# In your project directory, copy the example
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys
nano .env
```

Add your OpenRouter API key:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```

**IMPORTANT**: Never commit `.env` to git! It's already in `.gitignore`.
